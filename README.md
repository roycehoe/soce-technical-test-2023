# Task

**SOCE Technical Test 2023**

**Time limit:** 48 hours

**Scenario:**

Your uncle Jack has been running a minimart for a couple of years and wants to expand his business by setting up an online store. As someone with programming experience, you have volunteered to help him with this task.

**Objectives:**

To develop an MVP that will give your uncle a feel for what an online store would look and feel like, you are required to create an application with the following features:

| Frontend Webpage                                                                                                                                       | Backend API Server                                                                                                                                   |
| :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <p>- User view for users to browse items from the store. (Payment processing is not required)</p><p>- Admin view for admins to manage their items.</p> | <p>- CREATE an item in the store.</p><p>- READ all items in the store.</p><p>- UPDATE an item in the store.</p><p>- DELETE an item in the store.</p> |

Your uncle is also concerned about security. Specifically, he previously worked for an IT company, and they typically fail their Penetration Testing audit due to poor input validation and poor logging practices. Your uncle does not know anything about “input validation” nor “logging” (he knows that is not something he can eat) and hopes you can address them in your web application. Be sure you can explain the implemented security measures to your uncle the next time you meet him.

**Optional Objectives:**

The following are possible improvements to further impress your uncle but are not necessary:

1. Extra points for additional useful features.
1. Extra points for good frontend design (frontend).
1. Extra points for usage of database wrapper – ORM (backend).
1. Usage of container technologies such as Docker or Kubernetes.
1. Usage of cloud technologies such as AWS, GCP or Azure.
   \*\*

**Instructions:**

1. Create a public repository on any online git repository (such as Github or Gitlab).
1. Include a readme file within the repository which describes clearly:
   1. Steps required to run your developed application.
   1. All objectives that you have attempted.
1. Upon completion, deploy the application. Email us the following for assessment:
   1. URL to your deployed application.
   1. URL to your public git repository.
